            <p>This is an Arcade cabinet that I built summer 2022 for my college apartment. It now lives with an elementary teacher and dear friend Sean Hutch.</p>

            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nathan-Shoults/resume/main/smartlock.jpg" alt="Project 3 Image">
            <p>This is a smart lock that I designed and built that used an ESP32 Dev board and a MG995 Servo to detect my phone and unlock my front door.</p>

            <p>This is my dad and I doing an engine swap on our 1998 Suzuki Samuari (I also blew the differential and had to replace the rear axle).</p>

            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nathan-Shoults/resume/main/IMG_5542.JPG" alt="Project 4 Image">
            <p>This is the dissasembled two stroke engine that I bought for like $10 from the scrap yard because it's piston was fused to the cylinder. I bought a new piston and rebuilt it, the thing goes 80 now.</p>

            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nathan-Shoults/resume/main/IMG_8949.jpg" alt="Project 4 Image">
            <p>This is a "hands-free" flamethrower and my first project that utilized my 3D printer for the wrist mounts that held the buttons for the solenoids. I have since parted it all out sadly.</p>
